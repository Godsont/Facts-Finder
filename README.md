Hi this is a Fact Finder App I just created for those who are trying to learn React JS by actually creating a project.

## Facts Finder

Using this app, you can find significance of a date. You can select the date you want and it will show you a fact associated with that date. You can also view a fact for a random date. Hope you enjoy it.
